### Parametric form (3 from 3 due Nov. 3rd)

Create a module which accepts three parameters, capable of producting at least three different, but related, forums.

* Export .stl files of 3 different forms.
* Document with a GitHub repository. Standard format applies.
* No need to print these, but do include renders if you decide not to print.

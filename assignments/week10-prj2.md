### Project 2

Presentations on Nov 17th. Documentation Due by Nov 24th.

*This project is to be completed individually*.

For this project, I would like you to create and print a digital form by merging
at least two clean 3D scans of one or more humans.

Use any modeling tools that you like. I recommend [Autodesk MeshMixer](http://www.meshmixer.com/download.html).

Mateo kindly pointed out that the lab machines in Brown 217 have licenses for Skanect Pro - you can use these to export the full resolution scans if you like.

The dFab lab machines may also have full licenses. You will want to double-check before exporting.

Today is a work session - time to use the scanners, brainstorm with other
students, do your modeling, and print.

Presentations and critique will happen next week.

Schedule:

Nov. 10th: Work session. Scan (help each other scan). Model. Print.  
Nov. 17th: Project presentations.  
Nov. 24th: Documentation due.

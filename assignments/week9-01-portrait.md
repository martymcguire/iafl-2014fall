### Manipulate your self portrait .stl with OpenSCAD (due Nov. 10th)

Use a combination of `import()` and `for(){}` to manipulate your self portrait.

* `import()` function ([info](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/STL_Import_and_Export))
* `for(){}` loops ([info](http://www.spolearninglab.com/curriculum/lessonPlans/hacking/resources/software/3d/openscad/openscad_loops.html))
* When imported, an .stl file can be manipulated like any other form (including `intersect()` and `difference()`).
* IMPORTANT: The .stl file must be in the same folder as your OpenSCAD file.
* Be sure to document on GitHub.

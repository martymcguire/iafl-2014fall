### Do this stuff:

* OpenSCAD introduction tutorial ([link](http://spolearninglab.com/curriculum/software/3d_modeling/openscad_intro.html))
	* The navigation is a little confusing. Follow the links in the upper-right.
* Begin working on a small form (less than 4cm in its biggest direction). Try starting with something that has a flat bottom and minimal overhang. Bring .scad file to class next week.

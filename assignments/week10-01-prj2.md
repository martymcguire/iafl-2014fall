### Project 2

Finish cleaning up your scans, manipulating your forms, and printing.

Presentations and critique will happen next class.

If you still have printing to do after class today, it is your responsibility to make time to visit the lab. Please take note of the lab's hours and/or talk to Ryan regarding options.

You can also take advantage of the new printers in Brown 217.

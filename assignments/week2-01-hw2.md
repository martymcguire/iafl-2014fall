### Do this stuff:

* OpenSCAD tutorial 2 (ignore multmatrix) ([here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations))
* Begin working on a small form (less than 6cm in its biggest direction). Bring .scad file to class next week. You will have time to work on your forms in class, but printing priority goes to those with finished models.

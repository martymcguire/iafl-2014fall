The [Ponoko Starter Kit for Adobe Illustrator](http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/adobe-illustrator).

While it is geared towards the specific offerings of the Ponoko manufacturing service, their starter kit has lots of good information about creating designs in Illustrator that will produce good results on a laser cutter.

Some things to note:

* We're limiting our materials to birch plywood and acrylic.
* The dFab lasers only fit materials around 24"x12".
* We have our own [dFab Laser Template for Illustrator]({{urls.media}}/weeks/05/dFab_LaserTemplate.ai).

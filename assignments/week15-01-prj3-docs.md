### Project 3 documentation due December 19, 2014

I need the following from each student:

* 1 high quality, edited image (minimum) of your finished form. Neutral backdrop.
* 1 brief, edited video<strong>*</strong> of your work if there is an interactive component. 1-3 minutes. No music please.
* Files (excluding video/series of images) uploaded to each student's GitHub account using the repository structure established for classwork (src, exported, readme, license, images)
* In addition to the usual GitHub stuff, each repository should also contain a brief (roughly 200 word) PDF describing your project (goals, choices made, outcome, etc.)

<strong>*</strong> A series of 5-6 high quality, edited photographs documenting the interaction can be substituted for a video

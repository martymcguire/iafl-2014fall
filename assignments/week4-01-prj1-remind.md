### Project is due next week

Complete project. If you still have printing to do after class today, it is your responsibility to make time to visit the lab. Please take note of the lab's hours and/or talk to Ryan regarding options.

Two important things:

* *Do not wait until the last minute to print. (This will not be an acceptable excuse next week for your incomplete work.*
* The dFab lab is not a turnkey fabrication service. You must monitor your own prints.

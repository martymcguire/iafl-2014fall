### Before October 27th Class - Do This

Design a simple form to cut/engrave on the laser using your own materials.

* "Simple" meaning something you can cut out of a single sheet of a material of your choice no larger than 18"x12".
* You should use Illustrator (start with the template!) to create your design.
* Remember to cut during [dFab Laser Hours]({{urls.media}}/dFab%20Shop%20Hours%202014%20Fall.pdf).
	* Note that the dFab will be closed Monday and Tuesday October 20 and 21st.
* Create a GitHub repository (name it `IAFL2014-HW3`) for your design including:
	* A `source` folder with your Illustrator (`.ai`) file.
	* An `images` folder with images of your finished assembly.
	* A `README.md` file including:
		* The assignment description.
		* About 200 words describing your project.
		* The laser settings (speed, power, frequency) that you used for cutting and/or engraving.

Don Norman on affordances

*This project is to be completed by 2 people (a group of 3 is okay).*

For the first project, I would like you to create a set of objects (1 per person in your group) which are somehow connected by a non-printed found object. Use the found object's pre-existing affordances to create or highlight a relationship between the printed parts. The dimensions of your printed objects will be determnined by the properties of your found object.

Let's pick partners today (maybe right now?) Let me know in person or by email when you've
 formed a group.

Schedule:

This week: Form groups, find objects, choose ideas.  
Sept. 29th: Work session - measurements and printing.  
Oct. 6th: Project presentations.  
Oct. 13th: Documentation due.

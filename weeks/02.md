### Intro to UP!

Today I brought in an UP Plus 2. Also known as the Afinia H-Series.

* These belong to the Interactive Arts dept.
* Available in Brown 217 (door is coded)
* Grab the [UP! Software](http://www.pp3dp.com/index.php?option=com_jdownloads&view=viewcategory&catid=1&Itemid=90)
* Be sure to follow the steps in the <a href="{{urls.media}}/weeks/02/Afinia-H480-3D-Printer-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf">Quick Start Guide</a>.
 * Heat and test extrusion
 * Use the leveling probe to auto-level the bed
 * Use the nozzle height probe to automatically determing nozzle height
 * Print!

If you get an error about the print being [out of bounds](http://pp3dp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=602), check the settings under **3D Print | Calibrate**. Click the **Reset** button, then set X1, X2, Z, and H to these values:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{urls.media}}/weeks/02/up_calibrate_xyz.png" alt="X1: 124, X2: 124, Z: 0.0, H: 42" />

X1: 124, X2: 124, Z: 0.0, H: 42

### Homework Review

* Let's look these over!
* Please name your OpenSCAD file like so: `lastname_firstname_hw1.scad`
* Upload them to the [HW1 Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/a/mica.edu/?tab=mo#folders/0B7mVHIpNW9snQk1sZUYzTHpocG8)

### Review OpenSCAD Basics

Any questions about [OpenSCAD tutorial](http://spolearninglab.com/curriculum/software/3d_modeling/openscad_intro.html)?

* Basic forms (cube, sphere, cylinder)
* Transformations (scale, color, rotate, translate)
* Combining forms (difference, intersection, union)
* Compiling and rendering
* Exporting .stl file

### NetFabb Basic

Netfabb Basic is a free program which can be used to verify and repair .stl files. You will need to use this if Slic3r complains about a hole in your .stl file.

* Repairing files
* Exporting repaired .stl files
* [Instructions here](http://www.shapeways.com/tutorials/how_to_use_meshlab_and_netfabb).

Even better:

* [NetFabb Cloud](https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/) can do all of these things for you with a simple upload to your browser.

### Slic3r (part 2)

* Multiple objects on the same plate.
* Brims and support material.

### Let's print some stuff!

*If you were in the last groups to print last week, then you are first to print today.*

Print with a partner. Please plate both objects together in Slic3r and then generate G-Code.

If you are really not interested in printing the form you made with OpenSCAD over the weekend, you have two choices:

* Make another form!
* Print out one of the .stl files from the Free Universal Connector Kit

#### Remember to "kick the tires"

Before you home the printer, you must inspect the printer. EVERY TIME!

* These printers have 3 endstops (switches). Know where they are.
* Move X and Y axis until you hear click of the switches. You will be heading oward the front left corner of the bed.
* Look at Z endstop. Does it look like it lines up with the x-carriage above it? Make sure it does.
* Put fingertip on the endstop and click the Home Z button in Printrun. Still look good? Hit home button again.
* Ideal spacing between nozzle and the glass bed is just enough space to fit a piece of paper under. Adjust endstop until it feels right.
* Test other areas on the bed by tunring off motors in Printrun and manually moving X and Y. Use corner levelers if it is way off.
* Clean off any old residue with a scraper. Clean dust and grease with vinegar and paper towel. Clean bed!
* Pre-heat the extruder and do a test extrusion before starting your print.
  * Pre-heat the bed, too!
* EVERY TIME!

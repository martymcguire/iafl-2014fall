* HW3 (laser cutting) review
* Toolmaking
* Lunch
* Reading Discussion
* Parameterization!

### Project 1 Peer Review Forms

Take a few minutes to fill out the peer review forms that I will send to your MICA email address.

 The details of the forms will be kept private, so please feel free to answer each question honestly.

### HW3 Review

Similar to our project 1 review process.

* Show and discuss objects
* Talk about techniques used, lessons learned

### Toolmaking

### LUNCH

### Discuss reading (excerpts from The System of Objects)

You will have 5 minutes to review the reading to pick out something which you find interesting and would like to discuss.

### Parametric Design

A parametric form is designed to accept input in the form of parameters or arguments. The parametric toolkit for OpenSCAD consists of:

* Variables (a named value which can be used as a parameter) [More info...](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Variables)
* Modules (instructions to build forms which can be reused and accept parameters) [More info...](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Modules)
* Conditional statements (can be used to signal different versions or characteristics of forms from input parameters) [More info...](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#If_Statement)
Brief and helpful suggestions for making your design parametric: [link](http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2011/10/25/designing-for-parametrics-in-openscad/)

Let's look at a parametric wrench ([link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:82067/)).

### Homework

<div class="well" name="homework">
	<h3>Printable tool research (due on Nov. 10th)</h3>
	<p>
		Find a tool which you think might be useful to you. Document your experience using the tool:
		</p><ul>
			<li>I recommend searching for your tool on <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>.</li>
			<li>Have tool file(s) in class next week for printing.</li>
			<li>Try to use the tool as much as possible over the course of a week (minimum 3 uses); making notes or taking photos to document the experience.</li>
			<li>Roughly 200 word (half page) document saved as a .pdf which describes your experience with the tool, including any suggestions you have for modifying it to better suit your needs.</li>
			<li>Include at least 3 photos with documentation.</li>
		</ul>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Parametric form (3 from 3 due Nov. 3th)</h3>
	<p>
		Create a module which accepts three parameters, capable of producing at least three different, but related, forms.
	</p><ul>
		<li>Export .stl files of 3 different forms.</li>
		<li>Document with a GitHub repository. Standard format applies.</li>
		<li>No need to print these, but do include renders if you decide not to print.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
</div>

[1962](http://raphaelbastide.com/1962/) by Raphael Bastide ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/raphaelbastide/1962))

* What is GitHub?
* Why should you care? (as artists/designers/people who like to share who are working with code)
* Repositories (What are they?, creating, forking, cloning)
* Simple workflow (work, commit, work, ...)
* Branches (how to create, how to merge)

### Slic3r Part 3

* Experiment with infill!
* Shells and fill settings.

### RepRap Filament Change

Easier to show than explain. Ask a tech to show you on your first try.

* Heat up hot end
* Motors off
* Pinch extruder to release tension on filament and pull filament out.
* Insert new filament and release.
* Extrude until filament color changes completely.

### NetFabb Cloud

Quick update from last week: NetFabb offers an online service for repairing STLs.

If you are having troubles, feel free to tree [NetFabb Cloud](https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/).

### Print Some Stuff!

Print your objects from this weekend, either individually or with a partner (if your objects are small enough to fit on the same plate). Experiment with infill and shells to decrease print time. If you are unable to print today, you will have to visit the dFab lab before next week to finish.

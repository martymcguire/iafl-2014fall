[1962](http://raphaelbastide.com/1962/) by Raphael Bastide ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/raphaelbastide/1962))

* What is GitHub?
* Why should you care? (as artists/designers/people who like to share who are working with code)
* Repositories (What are they?, creating, forking, cloning)
* Simple workflow (work, commit, work, ...)
* Branches (how to create, how to merge)

### Slic3r Part 3

* Experiment with infill!
* Shells and fill settings.

### RepRap Filament Change

Easier to show than explain. Ask a tech to show you on your first try.

* Heat up hot end
* Motors off
* Pinch extruder to release tension on filament and pull filament out.
* Insert new filament and release.
* Extrude until filament color changes completely.

### NetFabb Cloud

Quick update from last week: NetFabb offers an online service for repairing STLs.

If you are having troubles, feel free to tree [NetFabb Cloud](https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/).

### Print Some Stuff!

Print your objects from this weekend, either individually or with a partner (if your objects are small enough to fit on the same plate). Experiment with infill and shells to decrease print time. If you are unable to print today, you will have to visit the dFab lab before next week to finish.

### Project 1: Conversation

Presentations on Oct. 6th. Documentation Due by Oct. 13th.

Don Norman on affordances

*This project is to be completed by 2 people (a group of 3 is okay).*

For the first project, I would like you to create a set of objects (1 per person in your group) which are somehow connected by a non-printed found object. Use the found object's pre-existing affordances to create or highlight a relationship between the printed parts. The dimensions of your printed objects will be determnined by the properties of your found object.

Let's pick partners today (maybe right now?) Let me know in person or by email when you've formed a group.

Schedule:

This week: Form groups, find objects, choose ideas.  
Sept. 29th: Work session - measurements and printing.  
Oct. 6th: Project presentations.  
Oct. 13th: Documentation due.

### Project 3 Presentations

Today, we'll take a look at the collective fruits of our labor.

Let's focus on providing thoughtful and constructive feedback for everyone.

I would like for this discussion to be led by you not me.

#### A little structure...

For each student:

* First, we (the audience) provide feedback or ask questions based on observation.
* Then, you (the presenters) can talk a bit about what you were trying to accomplish.
* Finally, back and forth between all of us.

### Course Evaluations

* Open your MICA mail (it must be your MICA mail account, or the link won't go to your specific evaluations)
* Look for an email with subject like "MICA Course Evaluations OPEN" (or "Reminder")
* Click on the Online Evaluations link in their email.
* Choose this course from the dashboard in EvaluationKit.
* Fill out the survey!

### Project 3 documentation due Friday, December 19, 2014

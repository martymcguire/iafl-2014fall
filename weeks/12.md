### Reminder: Project 2 Documentation is due today

Make sure your project documentation is in a GitHub repository, with all of the
required elements.

### More Project 2 presentations

For those that missed out last week.

Let's focus on providing thoughtful and constructive feedback for everyone.

I would like for this discussion to be led by you not me.

#### A little structure...

For each student:

* First, we (the audience) provide feedback or ask questions based on observation.
* Then, you (the presenters) can talk a bit about what you were trying to accomplish.
* Finally, back and forth between all of us.

### Lunch

Lunch time!

### Project 3: Self-Driven Research Project

The remainder of the semester is for you to realize one small, individual, personally driven research project.
This can include anything related to, or incorporating, 3D printing or laser cutting (or both).

You've all learned a lot of new tools and skills in this class. I want to see
you pushing the limits of your abilities!

* Chat (or email) with me about your project plan for the remaining two weeks (Dec. 1st)
* Work presentations will be on the last day of class (Dec. 15th)
* Documentation and source code pushed to GitHub no later than Dec. 19th.

### Remaining time

Work on your project documentation.

If you are missing any homeworks or project documentation, now is a chance to
work on those, as well.

Check the [Assignments Page]({{{urls.base_path}}}assignments/) to see if you are missing anything.

If you need help with anything, please let me know.

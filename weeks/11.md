### Project 2 presentations

Today, we'll take a look at the collective fruits of our labor.

Let's focus on providing thoughtful and constructive feedback for everyone.

I would like for this discussion to be led by you not me.

### A little structure...

For each group:

* First, we (the audience) provide feedback or ask questions based on observation.
* Then, you (the presenters) can talk a bit about what you were trying to accomplish.
* Finally, back and forth between all of us.

### Lunch

Lunch time!

### Printrbots in 217

Don't be afraid of them!

Do buy 1.75mm PLA!

Do watch these videos!

### Cura

Cura is a nice all-in-one slicing and printing solution that has some built-in support for Printrbots.

You can [download it here](http://software.ultimaker.com/).

You can find [the manual here](https://www.ultimaker.com/pages/support/manuals)

Please note that Cura is primarily developed by Ultimaker and their
documentation is largely geared towards their machine.

Still, the manual explains a lot about how to use the interface, where all of
the various settings and preferences live, it.

#### Using Cura with Printrbots

##### Startup Wizard - Choose Printrbot

##### Update Settings

The default Cura settings for Printrbot may not give the best results. Below are
some suggestions for getting a good profile together.

###### 1. **Nozzle size (mm)** to `0.4`
###### 2. Change **Start G-Code**

Suggestions can be found [here](http://help.printrbot.com/Answers/View/9116/Recommened+settings+%26+setup+for+using+Cura+with+Metal+Simple).

Remember that printers can differ. Your Mileage May Vary.

Example:

```
M104 S{print_temperature} ;set temperature line
G21 ;metric values
G90 ;absolute positioning
M82 ;set extruder to absolute mode
M107 ;start with the fan off
G28 X0 Y0 ;move X/Y to min endstops
G28 Z0 ;move Z to min endstops
M109 S{print_temperature} ;wait on temperature line
G29 ; Auto bed levelling
G92 E0 ;zero the extruded length
G1 F{travel_speed}
```

###### 3. Be sure to save your profile (**File | Save Profile**)

###### 4. Walk through Basic and Advanced print settings.

This should be familiar to you by now. Shells, infill, speed, temperature, filament diameter, etc.

###### 5. Slicing is automatic (and fast!)

##### Printing from Cura

Make sure the printer is plugged in.

**File | Print** !

### Remaining time

Work on your project documentation.

If you are missing any homeworks, now is a chance to work on those, as well.
Check the [Assignments Page]({{{urls.base_path}}}assignments/) to see if you are missing anything.

If you need help with anything, please let me know.

### Gentle Reminder

No food or drink in the dFab Lab.

Take turns with one another to take food and drink breaks.

### Project presentations

Today, we'll take a look at the collective fruits of our labor.

Let's focus on providing thoughtful and constructive feedback for everyone.

I would like for this discussion to be led by you not me.

### A little structure...

For each group:

* First, we (the audience) provide feedback or ask questions based on observation.
* Then, you (the presenters) can talk a bit about what you were trying to accomplish.
* Finally, back and forth between all of us.

### Remaining time

If you haven't already, convert your HW1 and HW2 turnins into 2 homework repositories on GitHub.

Follow the structure laid out in the [week 3 homework]({{urls.base_path}}weeks/03#toc_11) for credit.

If you need some help with GitHub, please let me know.

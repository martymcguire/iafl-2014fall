### Gentle Reminder

No food or drink in the dFab Lab.

Take turns with one another to take food and drink breaks.

### Project presentations

Today, we'll take a look at the collective fruits of our labor.

Let's focus on providing thoughtful and constructive feedback for everyone.

I would like for this discussion to be led by you not me.

### A little structure...

For each group:

* First, we (the audience) provide feedback or ask questions based on observation.
* Then, you (the presenters) can talk a bit about what you were trying to accomplish.
* Finally, back and forth between all of us.

### Remaining time

If you haven't already, convert your HW1 and HW2 turnins into 2 homework repositories on GitHub.

Follow the structure laid out in the [week 3 homework](http://localhost:9292/weeks/03#toc_11) for credit.

If you need some help with GitHub, please let me know.

### Homework

<div class="well">
	<h3>Project Documentation</h3>

	<p>I need the following from each group:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>1 high quality, edited image (minimum) of the connected forms plus an additional image of each individual form. Neutral backdrop.</li>
		<li>1 brief, edited video<strong>*</strong> of your work if there is an interactive component. 1-3 minutes. No music please.</li>
		<li>Files (excluding video/series of images) uploaded to all members' GitHub account using the repository structure established for classwork (src, exported, readme, license, images)</li>
		<li>In addition to the usual GitHub stuff, each repository should also contain a brief (roughly 200 word) PDF describing your project (goals, choices made, outcome, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>*</strong> A series of 5-6 high quality, edited photographs documenting the interaction can be substituted for a video

	<h3>Buy this</h3>

	<p>Time to get some laser materials!</p>

	<p>The easiest stuff to work with is going to be 1/8"-thick acrylic or birch plywood sheets. No larger than 3'x2'.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.inventables.com/">Inventables</a> is one of the most reputable places to order materials.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.inventables.com/categories/materials/hardwood-plywood-and-mdf?utf8=%E2%9C%93&selected_filters%5BType%5D%5B%5D=Plywood&selected_filters%5BThickness%5D%5B%5D=1%2F8+in">1/8" plywood</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.inventables.com/categories/materials/acrylic?utf8=%E2%9C%93&selected_filters%5BThickness%5D%5B%5D=1%2F8+in">1/8" acrylic</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Do this</h3>

	<p><em>Watch this Space</em></p>

	<p>I'm still working with Ryan McKibbin to choose the best software for you to use for laser cutting on the dFab lasers. I'll send out an email with a tutorial on using our target software for laser cutting early this week.</p>

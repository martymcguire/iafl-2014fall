### Let's Print Some Stuff!

Before we can do any printing, we need a file to print. Let's start with something simple:

* Resistor lead former ([link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26025))

### The Printing Toolchain (Part 1)

For more details and screenshots, feel free to check out the [dFab RepRap Workflow]({{urls.media}}/weeks/01/dFab_reprap_workflow.pdf).

Please install this software on your laptop:

* [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/) - 1.1.7 is stable, or press your luck with 1.2.0 experimental.
* [Printrun (aka Pronterface)](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun#getting-printrun)
* Slic3r configuration files for dFab RepRaps ([link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3rwR5mFpY3gTGRvX3BIZktSZDA&usp=sharing))
	* Grab the one for Prusa i2 3mm PLA

### Slic3r

* Slices an .stl file into a continuous toolpath, encoded in a language the printer can interpret (G-code)
* Setting up configuration file to work with department printers. Be sure to save the configuration for all 3 settings!
* Exploring the settings.
* Basic operation.
* Exporting g-code.

### Printrun

* Communicates with/controls the printer.
* Connecting to printer.
* Loading file.
* Setting hotend and bed temperatures. Watching temperature.
* Homing the printer ("kick tires" first).

### "Kicking the Tires"

Before you home the printer, you must inspect the printer. EVERY TIME!

* These printers have 3 endstops (switches). Know where they are.
* Move X and Y axis until you hear click of the switches. You will be heading oward the front left corner of the bed.
* Look at Z endstop. Does it look like it lines up with the x-carriage above it? Make sure it does.
* Put fingertip on the endstop and click the Home Z button in Printrun. Still look good? Hit home button again.
* Ideal spacing between nozzle and the glass bed is just enough space to fit a piece of paper under. Adjust endstop until it feels right.
* Test other areas on the bed by tunring off motors in Printrun and manually moving X and Y. Use corner levelers if it is way off.
* Clean off any old residue with a scraper. Clean dust and grease with vinegar and paper towel. Clean bed!
* EVERY TIME!

### First Prints

* Extrude some PLA to get things going. Hit the Extrude button in Printrun once to extrude 5mm.
* When everything is loaded, ready, and inspected, press the Print button.
* Make sure to stay close to the printer in case there is a problem. Check on it periodically.
* Pause the print if there is a problem.
* Turn off heat, scrape, and restart if you want to start over.
* In case of emergency, pull the POWER CABLE not the USB CABLE!
* Estimated time to print at bottom.
* When finished, the hotend and bed will turn off. When cool, you'll hear your parts crack off. Don't be impatient.

### Homework

<div class="well">
<h3>Order/buy 3mm PLA Filament (tonight or tomorrow).</h3>

<p>Make sure you're buying:</p>

<p>These vendors sell good quality stuff (There are many more online, but the quality varies. THIS KIND OF THING WILL CAUSE YOU/US HEADACHES):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ultimachine.com/catalog/print-materials/pla/pla-3mm">Ultimachine</a> (very high quality!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.protoparadigm.com/">Protoparadigm</a> (Also nice! 10% student discount. 2.2 lb. rolls only!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Install this stuff on your laptop:</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.netfabb.com/downloadcenter.php?basic=1">Netfabb Basic</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Read this stuff (we'll discuss it in 2 weeks):</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Medium</em> from Abstracting Craft: The Practiced Digital Hand, by Malcolm McCullough (<a href="{{urls.media}}/weeks/01/medium.pdf">link</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do this stuff:</h3>

<ul>
<li>OpenSCAD introduction tutorial (<a href="http://spolearninglab.com/curriculum/software/3d_modeling/openscad_intro.html">link</a>)</li>
  <ul><li>The navigation is a little confusing. Follow the links in the upper-right.</li></ul>
<li>Begin working on a small form (less than 4cm in its biggest direction). Try starting with something that has a flat bottom and minimal overhang. Bring .scad file to class next week</li>
</ul>
